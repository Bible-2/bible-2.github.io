    <p>1:1: Aight so there was this pretty neat guy called like god or some shit like that. Basically he like had some explosions in space make chemicals and shit, eventually leading to dust and rock and like water which made earth n stuff. He thought it was pretty entertaining so he like, waited some more and watched evolution happen n allat. It was pretty neat because he saw fish turn in to homosapiens over time and like trees and all that shit. Speaking of which, shit was holy, it was so holy that 'holy shit!' became a popular phrase among (us) humans later on. Anyways, after a while, god needed a guy to like go down and show the humans to be kind n all that, so he found someone online named RNGesus and told him to like go down onto earth and like heelp people. Basically what RNGesus did was like go to parties and turn water into alcohol, he like did some party tricks like walking on water. He was a real homie. Anyways later on someone didn't like him and like shot him with a gun. Anyways, apparently he can like possess someone and come back or some shit like that but I think he was waiting for gen alpha to teach the world how to like, not be stupid.</p>
